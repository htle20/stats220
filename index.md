### Where did the idea for the meme come from?
The motivation behind this meme is something that happens often to me. My friends are awake in a discord call at around 1AM studying together and asked if I wanted to study with them. 
I respond by telling them I was feeling too tired to study but as soon as they asked me to play valorant, 
I had become wide awake and was ready to play some games. 
The meme I have created is an adaption to an existing meme such as the Hotline Bling Drake meme where there are images showing different reactions to liking something more than the other.
